One of the main advantages of the exposome approach, compared to more traditional ones like "one exposure, one disease," is that it provides a framework for studying multiple environmental risks (urban, chemical, lifestyle, social, among others) and their combined effects on human health.

The exposome is defined as "the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onward." This concept recognizes that individuals are simultaneously exposed to multiple different environmental factors, adopting a holistic approach to discovering the etiological factors of diseases. The main advantage of the exposome approach, compared to more traditional ones like "one exposure, one disease," is that it provides a framework for studying multiple environmental risks (urban, chemical, lifestyle, social, among others) and their combined effects.

The objective of this session is to provide an introduction to the various statistical approaches necessary to answer the main research questions in exposomes; therefore, in this session:

***1. Descriptive Analysis***: In the first part of the session, we will work on the concept of descriptive analysis in exposomes, through which initial conclusions are drawn from the data. Among other objectives, descriptive analysis aims to identify possible outliers, confounding factors, or variables that require transformations prior to analysis. It also allows for a preliminary comparison of the experimental groups under study, the examination of correlation patterns between exposure factors, and the identification of clustering phenomena in the data (both at the individual and characteristic levels), essential steps for choosing the most appropriate subsequent statistical approach.

Some of the topics we will cover in this section include:

- Visualizing the distribution and concentration of exposome variables.

- Correlation between exposures.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to exposome variables.

***2. Association Analysis***: Association analysis aims to identify potential environmental exposure factors associated with various health parameters. This section will present different holistic analytical approaches focused on studying the effects of multiple exposure factors and their mixtures on health. This includes models such as ExWAS (Exposome-Wide Association Analysis). During this section, key concepts in exposome analysis, such as feature selection and multiple test correction, will be introduced.

Some of the topics covered in this section include:

- Exposure-Wide Association Analysis (ExWAS).

- Methods for variable selection (Stepwise, Elastic Net).
